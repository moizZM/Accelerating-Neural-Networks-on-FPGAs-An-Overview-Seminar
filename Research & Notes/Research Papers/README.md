In one real project, the designers used an FPGA (Spartan 3E) to run a complete system using three Microblaze processors. These processors were created inside the FPGA using its programmable fabric. Each processor had a special job. The first one handled communication with the PC. The second had a memory cache and worked with the filter block. The third one showed results on a monitor. This setup shows how FPGAs can be used to build custom parallel systems. It also shows how different blocks in an FPGA can work together to process data in real time.
