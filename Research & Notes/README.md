### Main topic: Accelerating Neural Networks on FPGAs

Sub-questions:

What is FPGA architecture and why is it suitable for neural networks?

What are the common FPGA acceleration techniques (parallelism, pipelining, quantization)?

How do FPGAs compare to CPUs/GPUs for NN workloads?

What are the design frameworks (e.g., Xilinx Vitis AI, Intel OpenVINO)?

What challenges exist (memory bandwidth, resource utilization, development time)?

What are future research directions (dynamic reconfiguration, hybrid systems, etc.)?
