### Main topic: Accelerating Neural Networks on FPGAs

Sub-questions:

> 1: What is FPGA architecture and why is it suitable for neural networks?

 2:What are the design frameworks (e.g., Xilinx Vitis AI, Intel OpenVINO)?

> 3: What are the common FPGA acceleration techniques (parallelism, pipelining, quantization)?

> 4: How do FPGAs compare to CPUs/GPUs for NN workloads?

> 5: What challenges exist (memory bandwidth, resource utilization, development time)?

> 6: What are future research directions (dynamic reconfiguration, hybrid systems, etc.)?
